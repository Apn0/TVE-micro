# UI alignment with reference screenshots

## Feeder motor card
- The Home screen overlays a **Feeder motor** card on the hopper schematic. It shows live RPM and the setpoint side by side in the same layout and green-accented numeric style seen in the reference feeder RPM tile.
- The dedicated Motor screen also highlights the Feeder card with its RPM value, using green when running and black when stopped to mirror the assignment RPM tile behavior.

## Missing centimeter readout
- None of the current screens render a card equivalent to the "SV-vulpeil 45 cm" display from the reference. Other sensor/status cards follow the same label-plus-large-value pattern (heater temps, fan speed), but none present centimeter units yet.
